			<p>The officers were about to take leave, but Prince Andréy, apparently reluctant to be left alone with his friend, asked them to stay and have tea. Seats were brought in and so was the tea. The officers gazed with surprise at Pierre’s huge stout figure and listened to his talk of Moscow and the position of our army, round which he had ridden. Prince Andréy remained silent, and his expression was so forbidding that Pierre addressed his remarks chiefly to the good-natured battalion commander.</p>
			<p>“So you understand the whole position of our troops?” Prince Andréy interrupted him.</p>
			<p>“Yes⁠—that is, how do you mean?” said Pierre. “Not being a military man I can’t say I have understood it fully, but I understand the general position.”</p>
			<p>“Well, then, you know more than anyone else, be it who it may,” said Prince Andréy.</p>
			<p>“Oh!” said Pierre, looking over his spectacles in perplexity at Prince Andréy. “Well, and what do you think of Kutúzov’s appointment?” he asked.</p>
			<p>“I was very glad of his appointment, that’s all I know,” replied Prince Andréy.</p>
			<p>“And tell me your opinion of Barclay de Tolly. In Moscow they are saying heaven knows what about him.⁠ ⁠… What do you think of him?”</p>
			<p>“Ask them,” replied Prince Andréy, indicating the officers.</p>
			<p>Pierre looked at Timókhin with the condescendingly interrogative smile with which everybody involuntarily addressed that officer.</p>
			<p>“We see light again, since his Serenity has been appointed, your excellency,” said Timókhin timidly, and continually turning to glance at his colonel.</p>
			<p>“Why so?” asked Pierre.</p>
			<p>“Well, to mention only firewood and fodder, let me inform you. Why, when we were retreating from Sventsyáni we dare not touch a stick or a wisp of hay or anything. You see, we were going away, so <em>he</em> would get it all; wasn’t it so, your excellency?” and again Timókhin turned to the prince. “But we daren’t. In our regiment two officers were court-martialed for that kind of thing. But when his Serenity took command everything became straightforward. Now we see light.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“Then why was it forbidden?”</p>
			<p>Timókhin looked about in confusion, not knowing what or how to answer such a question. Pierre put the same question to Prince Andréy.</p>
			<p>“Why, so as not to lay waste the country we were abandoning to the enemy,” said Prince Andréy with venomous irony. “It is very sound: one can’t permit the land to be pillaged and accustom the troops to marauding. At Smolénsk too he judged correctly that the French might outflank us, as they had larger forces. But he could not understand this,” cried Prince Andréy in a shrill voice that seemed to escape him involuntarily: “he could not understand that there, for the first time, we were fighting for Russian soil, and that there was a spirit in the men such as I had never seen before, that we had held the French for two days, and that that success had increased our strength tenfold. He ordered us to retreat, and all our efforts and losses went for nothing. He had no thought of betraying us, he tried to do the best he could, he thought out everything, and that is why he is unsuitable. He is unsuitable now, just because he plans out everything very thoroughly and accurately as every German has to. How can I explain?⁠ ⁠… Well, say your father has a German valet, and he is a splendid valet and satisfies your father’s requirements better than you could, then it’s all right to let him serve. But if your father is mortally sick you’ll send the valet away and attend to your father with your own unpracticed, awkward hands, and will soothe him better than a skilled man who is a stranger could. So it has been with Barclay. While Russia was well, a foreigner could serve her and be a splendid minister; but as soon as she is in danger she needs one of her own kin. But in your Club they have been making him out a traitor! They slander him as a traitor, and the only result will be that afterwards, ashamed of their false accusations, they will make him out a hero or a genius instead of a traitor, and that will be still more unjust. He is an honest and very punctilious German.”</p>
			<p>“And they say he’s a skillful commander,” rejoined Pierre.</p>
			<p>“I don’t understand what is meant by ‘a skillful commander,’ ” replied Prince Andréy ironically.</p>
			<p>“A skillful commander?” replied Pierre. “Why, one who foresees all contingencies⁠ ⁠… and foresees the adversary’s intentions.”</p>
			<p>“But that’s impossible,” said Prince Andréy as if it were a matter settled long ago.</p>
			<p>Pierre looked at him in surprise.</p>
			<p>“And yet they say that war is like a game of chess?” he remarked.</p>
			<p>“Yes,” replied Prince Andréy, “but with this little difference, that in chess you may think over each move as long as you please and are not limited for time, and with this difference too, that a knight is always stronger than a pawn, and two pawns are always stronger than one, while in war a battalion is sometimes stronger than a division and sometimes weaker than a company. The relative strength of bodies of troops can never be known to anyone. Believe me,” he went on, “if things depended on arrangements made by the staff, I should be there making arrangements, but instead of that I have the honor to serve here in the regiment with these gentlemen, and I consider that on us tomorrow’s battle will depend and not on those others.⁠ ⁠… Success never depends, and never will depend, on position, or equipment, or even on numbers, and least of all on position.”</p>
			<p>“But on what then?”</p>
			<p>“On the feeling that is in me and in him,” he pointed to Timókhin, “and in each soldier.”</p>
			<p>Prince Andréy glanced at Timókhin, who looked at his commander in alarm and bewilderment. In contrast to his former reticent taciturnity Prince Andréy now seemed excited. He could apparently not refrain from expressing the thoughts that had suddenly occurred to him.</p>
			<p>“A battle is won by those who firmly resolve to win it! Why did we lose the battle at Austerlitz? The French losses were almost equal to ours, but very early we said to ourselves that we were losing the battle, and we did lose it. And we said so because we had nothing to fight for there, we wanted to get away from the battlefield as soon as we could. ‘We’ve lost, so let us run,’ and we ran. If we had not said that till the evening, heaven knows what might not have happened. But tomorrow we shan’t say it! You talk about our position, the left flank weak and the right flank too extended,” he went on. “That’s all nonsense, there’s nothing of the kind. But what awaits us tomorrow? A hundred million most diverse chances which will be decided on the instant by the fact that our men or theirs run or do not run, and that this man or that man is killed, but all that is being done at present is only play. The fact is that those men with whom you have ridden round the position not only do not help matters, but hinder. They are only concerned with their own petty interests.”</p>
			<p>“At such a moment?” said Pierre reproachfully.</p>
			<p>“<em>At such a moment!</em>” Prince Andréy repeated. “To them it is only a moment affording opportunities to undermine a rival and obtain an extra cross or ribbon. For me tomorrow means this: a Russian army of a hundred thousand and a French army of a hundred thousand have met to fight, and the thing is that these two hundred thousand men <em>will</em> fight and the side that fights more fiercely and spares itself least will win. And if you like I will tell you that whatever happens and whatever muddles those at the top may make, we shall win tomorrow’s battle. Tomorrow, happen what may, we shall win!”</p>
			<p>“There now, your excellency! That’s the truth, the real truth,” said Timókhin. “Who would spare himself now? The soldiers in my battalion, believe me, wouldn’t drink their vodka! ‘It’s not the day for that!’ they say.”</p>
			<p>All were silent. The officers rose. Prince Andréy went out of the shed with them, giving final orders to the adjutant. After they had gone Pierre approached Prince Andréy and was about to start a conversation when they heard the clatter of three horses’ hoofs on the road not far from the shed, and looking in that direction Prince Andréy recognized Wolzogen and Clausewitz accompanied by a Cossack. They rode close by continuing to converse, and Prince Andréy involuntarily heard these words:</p>
			<p>“<i xml:lang="de">Der Krieg muss in Raum verlegt werden. Der Ansicht kann ich nicht genug Preis geben</i>,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-92" id="noteref-92" epub:type="noteref">92</a> said one of them.</p>
			<p>“<i xml:lang="de">Oh, ja</i>,” said the other, “<i xml:lang="de">der Zweck ist nur den Feind zu schwächen, so kann man gewiss nicht den Verlust der Privat-Personen in Achtung nehmen.</i>”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-93" id="noteref-93" epub:type="noteref">93</a></p>
			<p>“Oh, no,” agreed the other.</p>
			<p>“Extend widely!” said Prince Andréy with an angry snort, when they had ridden past. “In that ‘extend’ were my father, son, and sister, at Bald Hills. That’s all the same to him! That’s what I was saying to you⁠—those German gentlemen won’t win the battle tomorrow but will only make all the mess they can, because they have nothing in their German heads but theories not worth an empty eggshell and haven’t in their hearts the one thing needed tomorrow⁠—that which Timókhin has. They have yielded up all Europe to <em>him</em>, and have now come to teach us. Fine teachers!” and again his voice grew shrill.</p>
			<p>“So you think we shall win tomorrow’s battle?” asked Pierre.</p>
			<p>“Yes, yes,” answered Prince Andréy absently. “One thing I would do if I had the power,” he began again, “I would not take prisoners. Why take prisoners? It’s chivalry! The French have destroyed my home and are on their way to destroy Moscow, they have outraged and are outraging me every moment. They are my enemies. In my opinion they are all criminals. And so thinks Timókhin and the whole army. They should be executed! Since they are my foes they cannot be my friends, whatever may have been said at Tilsit.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, yes,” muttered Pierre, looking with shining eyes at Prince Andréy. “I quite agree with you!”</p>
			<p>The question that had perturbed Pierre on the Mozháysk hill and all that day now seemed to him quite clear and completely solved. He now understood the whole meaning and importance of this war and of the impending battle. All he had seen that day, all the significant and stern expressions on the faces he had seen in passing, were lit up for him by a new light. He understood that latent heat (as they say in physics) of patriotism which was present in all these men he had seen, and this explained to him why they all prepared for death calmly, and as it were lightheartedly.</p>
			<p>“Not take prisoners,” Prince Andréy continued: “That by itself would quite change the whole war and make it less cruel. As it is we have played at war⁠—that’s what’s vile! We play at magnanimity and all that stuff. Such magnanimity and sensibility are like the magnanimity and sensibility of a lady who faints when she sees a calf being killed: she is so kindhearted that she can’t look at blood, but enjoys eating the calf served up with sauce. They talk to us of the rules of war, of chivalry, of flags of truce, of mercy to the unfortunate and so on. It’s all rubbish! I saw chivalry and flags of truce in 1805; they humbugged us and we humbugged them. They plunder other people’s houses, issue false paper money, and worst of all they kill my children and my father, and then talk of rules of war and magnanimity to foes! Take no prisoners, but kill and be killed! He who has come to this as I have through the same sufferings⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>Prince Andréy, who had thought it was all the same to him whether or not Moscow was taken as Smolénsk had been, was suddenly checked in his speech by an unexpected cramp in his throat. He paced up and down a few times in silence, but his eyes glittered feverishly and his lips quivered as he began speaking.</p>
			<p>“If there was none of this magnanimity in war, we should go to war only when it was worth while going to certain death, as now. Then there would not be war because Pável Ivánovich had offended Mikháil Ivánovich. And when there was a war, like this one, it would be war! And then the determination of the troops would be quite different. Then all these Westphalians and Hessians whom Napoleon is leading would not follow him into Russia, and we should not go to fight in Austria and Prussia without knowing why. War is not courtesy but the most horrible thing in life; and we ought to understand that and not play at war. We ought to accept this terrible necessity sternly and seriously. It all lies in that: get rid of falsehood and let war be war and not a game. As it is now, war is the favorite pastime of the idle and frivolous. The military calling is the most highly honored.</p>
			<p>“But what is war? What is needed for success in warfare? What are the habits of the military? The aim of war is murder; the methods of war are spying, treachery, and their encouragement, the ruin of a country’s inhabitants, robbing them or stealing to provision the army, and fraud and falsehood termed military craft. The habits of the military class are the absence of freedom, that is, discipline, idleness, ignorance, cruelty, debauchery, and drunkenness. And in spite of all this it is the highest class, respected by everyone. All the kings, except the Chinese, wear military uniforms, and he who kills most people receives the highest rewards.</p>
			<p>“They meet, as we shall meet tomorrow, to murder one another; they kill and maim tens of thousands, and then have thanksgiving services for having killed so many people (they even exaggerate the number), and they announce a victory, supposing that the more people they have killed the greater their achievement. How does God above look at them and hear them?” exclaimed Prince Andréy in a shrill, piercing voice. “Ah, my friend, it has of late become hard for me to live. I see that I have begun to understand too much. And it doesn’t do for man to taste of the tree of knowledge of good and evil.⁠ ⁠… Ah, well, it’s not for long!” he added.</p>
			<p>“However, you’re sleepy, and it’s time for me to sleep. Go back to Górki!” said Prince Andréy suddenly.</p>
			<p>“Oh no!” Pierre replied, looking at Prince Andréy with frightened, compassionate eyes.</p>
			<p>“Go, go! Before a battle one must have one’s sleep out,” repeated Prince Andréy.</p>
			<p>He came quickly up to Pierre and embraced and kissed him. “Goodbye, be off!” he shouted. “Whether we meet again or not⁠ ⁠…” and turning away hurriedly he entered the shed.</p>
			<p>It was already dark, and Pierre could not make out whether the expression of Prince Andréy’s face was angry or tender.</p>
			<p>For some time he stood in silence considering whether he should follow him or go away. “No, he does not want it!” Pierre concluded. “And I know that this is our last meeting!” He sighed deeply and rode back to Górki.</p>
			<p>On re-entering the shed Prince Andréy lay down on a rug, but he could not sleep.</p>
			<p>He closed his eyes. One picture succeeded another in his imagination. On one of them he dwelt long and joyfully. He vividly recalled an evening in Petersburg. Natásha with animated and excited face was telling him how she had gone to look for mushrooms the previous summer and had lost her way in the big forest. She incoherently described the depths of the forest, her feelings, and a talk with a beekeeper she met, and constantly interrupted her story to say: “No, I can’t! I’m not telling it right; no, you don’t understand,” though he encouraged her by saying that he did understand, and he really had understood all she wanted to say. But Natásha was not satisfied with her own words: she felt that they did not convey the passionately poetic feeling she had experienced that day and wished to convey. “He was such a delightful old man, and it was so dark in the forest⁠ ⁠… and he had such kind⁠ ⁠… No, I can’t describe it,” she had said, flushed and excited. Prince Andréy smiled now the same happy smile as then when he had looked into her eyes. “I understood her,” he thought. “I not only understood her, but it was just that inner, spiritual force, that sincerity, that frankness of soul⁠—that very soul of hers which seemed to be fettered by her body⁠—it was that soul I loved in her⁠ ⁠… loved so strongly and happily⁠ ⁠…” and suddenly he remembered how his love had ended. “<em>He</em> did not need anything of that kind. <em>He</em> neither saw nor understood anything of the sort. He only saw in her a pretty and <em>fresh</em> young girl, with whom he did not deign to unite his fate. And I?⁠ ⁠… and he is still alive and gay!”</p>
			<p>Prince Andréy jumped up as if someone had burned him, and again began pacing up and down in front of the shed.</p>
