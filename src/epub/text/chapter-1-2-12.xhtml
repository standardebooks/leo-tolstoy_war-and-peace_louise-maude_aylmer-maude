					<p>At the levee Prince Andréy stood among the Austrian officers as he had been told to, and the Emperor Francis merely looked fixedly into his face and just nodded to him with his long head. But after it was over, the adjutant he had seen the previous day ceremoniously informed Bolkónski that the Emperor desired to give him an audience. The Emperor Francis received him standing in the middle of the room. Before the conversation began Prince Andréy was struck by the fact that the Emperor seemed confused and blushed as if not knowing what to say.</p>
					<p>“Tell me, when did the battle begin?” he asked hurriedly.</p>
					<p>Prince Andréy replied. Then followed other questions just as simple: “Was Kutúzov well? When had he left Krems?” and so on. The Emperor spoke as if his sole aim were to put a given number of questions⁠—the answers to these questions, as was only too evident, did not interest him.</p>
					<p>“At what o’clock did the battle begin?” asked the Emperor.</p>
					<p>“I cannot inform Your Majesty at what o’clock the battle began at the front, but at Dürrenstein, where I was, our attack began after five in the afternoon,” replied Bolkónski growing more animated and expecting that he would have a chance to give a reliable account, which he had ready in his mind, of all he knew and had seen. But the Emperor smiled and interrupted him.</p>
					<p>“How many miles?”</p>
					<p>“From where to where, Your Majesty?”</p>
					<p>“From Dürrenstein to Krems.”</p>
					<p>“Three and a half miles, Your Majesty.”</p>
					<p>“The French have abandoned the left bank?”</p>
					<p>“According to the scouts the last of them crossed on rafts during the night.”</p>
					<p>“Is there sufficient forage in Krems?”</p>
					<p>“Forage has not been supplied to the extent …”</p>
					<p>The Emperor interrupted him.</p>
					<p>“At what o’clock was General Schmidt killed?”</p>
					<p>“At seven o’clock, I believe.”</p>
					<p>“At seven o’clock? It’s very sad, very sad!”</p>
					<p>The Emperor thanked Prince Andréy and bowed. Prince Andréy withdrew and was immediately surrounded by courtiers on all sides. Everywhere he saw friendly looks and heard friendly words. Yesterday’s adjutant reproached him for not having stayed at the palace, and offered him his own house. The Minister of War came up and congratulated him on the Maria Theresa Order of the third grade, which the Emperor was conferring on him. The Empress’ chamberlain invited him to see Her Majesty. The archduchess also wished to see him. He did not know whom to answer, and for a few seconds collected his thoughts. Then the Russian ambassador took him by the shoulder, led him to the window, and began to talk to him.</p>
					<p>Contrary to Bilíbin’s forecast the news he had brought was joyfully received. A thanksgiving service was arranged, Kutúzov was awarded the Grand Cross of Maria Theresa, and the whole army received rewards. Bolkónski was invited everywhere, and had to spend the whole morning calling on the principal Austrian dignitaries. Between four and five in the afternoon, having made all his calls, he was returning to Bilíbin’s house thinking out a letter to his father about the battle and his visit to Brünn. At the door he found a vehicle half full of luggage. Franz, Bilíbin’s man, was dragging a portmanteau with some difficulty out of the front door.</p>
					<p>Before returning to Bilíbin’s Prince Andréy had gone to a bookshop to provide himself with some books for the campaign, and had spent some time in the shop.</p>
					<p>“What is it?” he asked.</p>
					<p>“Oh, your excellency!” said Franz, with difficulty rolling the portmanteau into the vehicle, “we are to move on still farther. The scoundrel is again at our heels!”</p>
					<p>“Eh? What?” asked Prince Andréy.</p>
					<p>Bilíbin came out to meet him. His usually calm face showed excitement.</p>
					<p>“There now! Confess that this is delightful,” said he. “This affair of the Thabor Bridge, at Vienna. … They have crossed without striking a blow!”</p>
					<p>Prince Andréy could not understand.</p>
					<p>“But where do you come from not to know what every coachman in the town knows?”</p>
					<p>“I come from the archduchess’. I heard nothing there.”</p>
					<p>“And you didn’t see that everybody is packing up?”</p>
					<p>“I did not … What is it all about?” inquired Prince Andréy impatiently.</p>
					<p>“What’s it all about? Why, the French have crossed the bridge that Auersperg was defending, and the bridge was not blown up: so Murat is now rushing along the road to Brünn and will be here in a day or two.”</p>
					<p>“What? Here? But why did they not blow up the bridge, if it was mined?”</p>
					<p>“That is what I ask you. No one, not even Bonaparte, knows why.”</p>
					<p>Bolkónski shrugged his shoulders.</p>
					<p>“But if the bridge is crossed it means that the army too is lost? It will be cut off,” said he.</p>
					<p>“That’s just it,” answered Bilíbin. “Listen! The French entered Vienna as I told you. Very well. Next day, which was yesterday, those gentlemen, <i xml:lang="fr">messieurs les maréchaux</i>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-30" id="noteref-30" epub:type="noteref">30</a> Murat, Lannes, and Belliard, mount and ride to the bridge. (Observe that all three are Gascons.) ‘Gentlemen,’ says one of them, ‘you know the Thabor Bridge is mined and doubly mined and that there are menacing fortifications at its head and an army of fifteen thousand men has been ordered to blow up the bridge and not let us cross? But it will please our sovereign the Emperor Napoleon if we take this bridge, so let us three go and take it!’ ‘Yes, let’s!’ say the others. And off they go and take the bridge, cross it, and now with their whole army are on this side of the Danube, marching on us, you, and your lines of communication.”</p>
					<p>“Stop jesting,” said Prince Andréy sadly and seriously. This news grieved him and yet he was pleased.</p>
					<p>As soon as he learned that the Russian army was in such a hopeless situation it occurred to him that it was he who was destined to lead it out of this position; that here was the Toulon that would lift him from the ranks of obscure officers and offer him the first step to fame! Listening to Bilíbin he was already imagining how on reaching the army he would give an opinion at the war council which would be the only one that could save the army, and how he alone would be entrusted with the executing of the plan.</p>
					<p>“Stop this jesting,” he said.</p>
					<p>“I am not jesting,” Bilíbin went on. “Nothing is truer or sadder. These gentlemen ride onto the bridge alone and wave white handkerchiefs; they assure the officer on duty that they, the marshals, are on their way to negotiate with Prince Auersperg. He lets them enter the <i xml:lang="fr">tête-de-pont</i>.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-31" id="noteref-31" epub:type="noteref">31</a> They spin him a thousand gasconades, saying that the war is over, that the Emperor Francis is arranging a meeting with Bonaparte, that they desire to see Prince Auersperg, and so on. The officer sends for Auersperg; these gentlemen embrace the officers, crack jokes, sit on the cannon, and meanwhile a French battalion gets to the bridge unobserved, flings the bags of incendiary material into the water, and approaches the <i xml:lang="fr">tête-de-pont</i>. At length appears the lieutenant general, our dear Prince Auersperg von Mautern himself. ‘Dearest foe! Flower of the Austrian army, hero of the Turkish wars! Hostilities are ended, we can shake one another’s hand. … The Emperor Napoleon burns with impatience to make Prince Auersperg’s acquaintance.’ In a word, those gentlemen, Gascons indeed, so bewildered him with fine words, and he is so flattered by his rapidly established intimacy with the French marshals, and so dazzled by the sight of Murat’s mantle and ostrich plumes, <i xml:lang="fr">qu’il n’y voit que du feu, et oublie celui qu’il devait faire faire sur l’ennemi!</i>”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-32" id="noteref-32" epub:type="noteref">32</a> In spite of the animation of his speech, Bilíbin did not forget to pause after this mot to give time for its due appreciation. “The French battalion rushes to the bridgehead, spikes the guns, and the bridge is taken! But what is best of all,” he went on, his excitement subsiding under the delightful interest of his own story, “is that the sergeant in charge of the cannon which was to give the signal to fire the mines and blow up the bridge, this sergeant, seeing that the French troops were running onto the bridge, was about to fire, but Lannes stayed his hand. The sergeant, who was evidently wiser than his general, goes up to Auersperg and says: ‘Prince, you are being deceived, here are the French!’ Murat, seeing that all is lost if the sergeant is allowed to speak, turns to Auersperg with feigned astonishment (he is a true Gascon) and says: ‘I don’t recognize the world-famous Austrian discipline, if you allow a subordinate to address you like that!’ It was a stroke of genius. Prince Auersperg feels his dignity at stake and orders the sergeant to be arrested. Come, you must own that this affair of the Thabor Bridge is delightful! It is not exactly stupidity, nor rascality. …”</p>
					<p>“It may be treachery,” said Prince Andréy, vividly imagining the gray overcoats, wounds, the smoke of gunpowder, the sounds of firing, and the glory that awaited him.</p>
					<p>“Not that either. That puts the court in too bad a light,” replied Bilíbin. “It’s not treachery nor rascality nor stupidity: it is just as at Ulm … it is …”⁠—he seemed to be trying to find the right expression. “ <i xml:lang="fr">C’est … c’est du Mack. Nous sommes mackés</i> (It is … it is a bit of Mack. We are <em>Macked</em>),” he concluded, feeling that he had produced a good epigram, a fresh one that would be repeated. His hitherto puckered brow became smooth as a sign of pleasure, and with a slight smile he began to examine his nails.</p>
					<p>“Where are you off to?” he said suddenly to Prince Andréy who had risen and was going toward his room.</p>
					<p>“I am going away.”</p>
					<p>“Where to?”</p>
					<p>“To the army.”</p>
					<p>“But you meant to stay another two days?”</p>
					<p>“But now I am off at once.”</p>
					<p>And Prince Andréy after giving directions about his departure went to his room.</p>
					<p>“Do you know, <i xml:lang="fr">mon cher</i>,” said Bilíbin following him, “I have been thinking about you. Why are you going?”</p>
					<p>And in proof of the conclusiveness of his opinion all the wrinkles vanished from his face.</p>
					<p>Prince Andréy looked inquiringly at him and gave no reply.</p>
					<p>“Why are you going? I know you think it your duty to gallop back to the army now that it is in danger. I understand that. <i xml:lang="fr">Mon cher</i>, it is heroism!”</p>
					<p>“Not at all,” said Prince Andréy.</p>
					<p>“But as you are a philosopher, be a consistent one, look at the other side of the question and you will see that your duty, on the contrary, is to take care of yourself. Leave it to those who are no longer fit for anything else. … You have not been ordered to return and have not been dismissed from here; therefore, you can stay and go with us wherever our ill luck takes us. They say we are going to Olmütz, and Olmütz is a very decent town. You and I will travel comfortably in my calèche.”</p>
					<p>“Do stop joking, Bilíbin,” cried Bolkónski.</p>
					<p>“I am speaking sincerely as a friend! Consider! Where and why are you going, when you might remain here? You are faced by one of two things,” and the skin over his left temple puckered, “either you will not reach your regiment before peace is concluded, or you will share defeat and disgrace with Kutúzov’s whole army.”</p>
					<p>And Bilíbin unwrinkled his temple, feeling that the dilemma was insoluble.</p>
					<p>“I cannot argue about it,” replied Prince Andréy coldly, but he thought: “I am going to save the army.”</p>
					<p>“My dear fellow, you are a hero!” said Bilíbin.</p>
